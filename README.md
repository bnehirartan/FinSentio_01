This project implements an advanced LLM-based Financial Advisor and Education Assistant system using cutting-edge AI techniques, including:

  - Function Calling (non-parametric grounding)
  - Multi-Agent Architecture
  - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
  - Prompt Engineering

These techniques empower the system to:
- Access and use up-to-date, real-world data
- Divide responsibilities between specialized agents
- Dynamically construct prompts tailored to user intent
- Provide source-backed, explainable financial answers

### Key Features
- Risk Assessment: Summarized in both table and natural language formats
- Real-Time Market Insights: Powered by APIs like Finnhub and FRED
- PDF-Based Financial Document Analysis
- Bilingual Support: Turkish ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· and English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
- Smart Prompting: Intent classification and tool selection for each query
- LLM Cost Tracking: Real-time token usage and pricing calculator

## Core Capabilities

- Financial data retrieval and analysis
- Investment and risk advice based on the saved user profile
- Veri toplama ve analiz
- Secure and modular PDF document processing
- PDF dosya iÅŸleme
- ChromaDB-based persistent knowledge storage
- Transparent usage cost calculation for LLM queries

## Installation


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [proje-url]
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Initialize the database:
```bash
python database.py
```

## Usage

Run the main app locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will launch a web interface (via Gradio) where users can interact with the system, fill out a profile, and receive real-time insights.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`:  Main application entry point. Launches the UI and integrates all system modules.
- `financial_assistant.py`: Financial education module and agent coordination
- `riskanalyzer.py`: Risk analysis tools, report generation, and the main part that generates the response to the user
- `dataretrieval.py`: API integrations, data processing, and tool building for the function calling
- `database.py`: User & session management via SQLite
- `llm_cost_calculator.py`: Gemini token cost estimation
- `ChromaDBData/`: ChromaDB persisted documents
- `chroma_db/`: ChromaDB configuration and embeddings
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
-  `users.db`: SQLite database file (auto-generated)

## Database

This project uses a lightweight SQLite database (users.db) for storing user information, login data, and risk profiles. No cloud database is required for local use.
